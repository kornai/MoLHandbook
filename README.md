This is the git site of the Handbook of Mathematical Linguistics. Each area
will have its own editor or editors.  We use the volumes "Mathematics of
Language" by Marcus Kracht and "Mathematical Linguistics" by Andras Kornai as
a 0th release.  Neither of these latexes perfectly at the moment, but there is
no need to fix this, since we won't include these in their entirety.  You can
start with
